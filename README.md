# SnapchatClone
Simple snapchat clone with Firebase. You can create new users and view snaps shared by other users. If users have more than one snap, they will not appear as a new post in the feed, they will be added to their previous posts as a slider. Posts will be automatically deleted after 24 hours. Once you log in, the application will remember you and you will not need to log in again until you click the "sign out" button.
